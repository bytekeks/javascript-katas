# Second problem

It is about splitting one array into a new one containing arrays with two elements.

See the following array of names:

```javascript
const array = [
  'Scott',
  'Buzz',
  'Patrick',
  'Henry',
  'Jack',
];
```

The expected result is:

```javascript
[
 ['Scott', 'Buzz'],
 ['Patrick', 'Henry'],
 ['Jack'],
]
```

Edit the following function (additional functions are allowed but not neccessary):

```javascript
function getNewArray(array) {
  // your code here
  return array;
}
```

The shorter the code, the cooler you are ;) Have phun!
