# Third problem

It is about adding values within a array of objects together.

See the following array of receipts:

```javascript
const array = [
  {
    receiptId: 1,
    amount: 4.50,
  },
  {
    receiptId: 2,
    amount: 4.50,
  },
  {
    receiptId: 3,
    amount: 1,
  },
];
```

The expected result is:

```javascript
10
```

Edit the following function (additional functions are allowed but not neccessary):

```javascript
function getNewArray(array) {
  // your code here
  return array;
}
```

The shorter the code, the cooler you are ;) Have phun!
